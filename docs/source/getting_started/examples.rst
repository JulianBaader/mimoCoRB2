Examples
--------

mimoCoRB2 comes with a set of examples that can be used to get started quickly. The
examples are located in the `examples` directory of the mimoCoRB2 package alongside
an explenation of the experiment. Each example is self-contained and can be run
independently. The examples stem from experiments currently running at KIT and are
meant to be used as a starting point for your own experiments.
