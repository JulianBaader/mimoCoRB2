# As a first step define all Buffers which are used in the setup.
# The Buffer is defined by the following attributes: 
# - name: a unique name for the Buffer
# - slot_count: the number of slots in the Buffer
# - data_length: The length of the structured array which is stored in a slot
# - dtype: The data type of the structured array
